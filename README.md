# xplane-avionics
This is a repository containing the project code for my modern avionics to use on custom aircraft in x-Plane 11. The code uses various elements which can be put together to fit the needs of different avionics setups. Currently, it is being tested in a custom A220/CSeries aircraft.

# Use
In short, this porject is supposed to be used as a library to ease the implementation of complex avionics user interfaces. The various DisplayElements can be seen as building blocks to create interactive displays in your custom X-Plane 11 aircraft.

To get a better idea of how to use this, check out the main.cpp file or the [wiki](https://github.com/halexc/xplane-avionics/wiki/Home). Be sure to include all the relevant files. Note that the resource files referenced in 'main.cpp' are not included in this repository, so you need to manually put them together
